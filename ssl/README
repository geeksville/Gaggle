This directory contains a single C file used to check the digital signature created by Gaggle.


/!\
/!\ BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, YOU SHOULD ADD THE PUBLIC KEY OF GAGGLE
/!\ AT THE BEGINING OF THE FILE.
/!\

The public key is expected to be in PEM format.


On *nix with gcc and lib openssl installed, you can compile it like this:

$ CFLAGS=-Wall LDFLAGS=-lssl make

Then running it is as simple as:

$ ./verify flight_1.igc

Return status is 0 when signature is verified, !=0 if not.
