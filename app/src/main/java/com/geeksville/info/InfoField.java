/**
 * The base class for little info widgets that can be placed in various
 * locations inside Gaggle
 * 
 * @author kevinh
 * 
 *         I'm not sure if I should instead be making these widgets Views or
 *         Drawables instead. However, both of those items seem too heavyweight
 *         in my initial impression. The idea is that these widgets live inside
 *         of an InfoFieldView. Users can long-click on those InfoDock to switch
 *         out info fields.
 * 
 *         An info field can return its information as a drawable and/or a
 *         string. It should also have a short label string and a much longer
 *         description string (for menus/self documenting UI)
 * 
 *         InfoDock is a linear layout(?) that contains a series of InfoFields
 *         For each info field we programatically make either a TextView or a
 *         ImageView. For each one we will optionally also include the label
