This is a brief summary of the steps needed to localize Gaggle for a new language:

1) Thank you for volunteering to do a translation!  How would you like your name to read in the credits?  What email address
	do you want to publish (if any)?
2) Use a simple text editor to edit this file (Notepad on Windows or gedit on Linux)
3) The strings in the table below are the english language version, if for your language you do not think it is appropriate
	to translate that line at all (i.e. we should show the english version), just delete the full XML string element from
	your file.
4) If you are not sure about a translation and would like to use english for a particular line until you know a bit more
	about how it is used in the program, just comment the line out using the XML comment delimeters.
5) Please try to keep the translated strings approximately the same length as their english versions.  That said, don't 
	worry about this too much - if you can't get a clear translation in the given length, feel free to use a longer phrase
	(I might need to fix some layout files in the app though).
6) If the name of a particular string has _short at the end, it is _is_ important to use the shortest possible translation.
	It is likely I'm using it in a very small summary field and abbreviations are okay.
7) After you make your translation, email the file to me and I'll add it to a test version of Gaggle.  After tweaking it
	a little, I'll send you a test version to see if you are also happy with our work.  Then it will be released in the
	regular distribution.
8) If a string spans multiple lines in this file, please try to keep the line breaks approximately the same in your 
	translation.
