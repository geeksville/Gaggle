It seems you haven't created any waypoints yet.  There are three ways to add waypoints:

<ul><li>If you visit a waypoint file on the web, when you open the file, just choose "Open with Gaggle".  
For an example, try downloading from the <a href="http://www.santacruzparagliding.com/NCXC/NCXC_2010_waypoints.wpt">Norcal XC league</a> or 
many waypoint files can be found in the <a href="http://soaringweb.org/TP">Worldwide Soaring Turnpoint Exchange</a>.    
<br /><br />The CompeGPS, OziExplorer, Cambridge .dat & SeeYou .cup waypoint formats are known to work.  If you'd like to see another format supported, please post a request in the 
<a href="manual/support.html">user forum</a>. <br />After importing a waypoint file, the file will be saved on your device. Look for the \Gaggle\Waypoints folder. <br /><br /></li>
<li>Open a file browser app on your android device. Browse to, then select a waypoint file. Gaggle will then import that file.</li>
<br /><br />
<li>You can add waypoints manually.  Just press Menu button and choose "Add waypoint."</li>
</ul>
