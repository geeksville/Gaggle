<h1>Two step guide to start recording flights</h1>
<p><ul><li>Select the tab with the paper plan.</li>
<li>Click the Start Logging button at the bottom of the screen</li></ul>
<p>Note that if GPS is turned off, the app will ask you to turn it on. Once you have done that, repeat the steps above.</p>
<p>The system will show the message: "Acquiring GPS fix" until your location as been determined at which point it will 
say "Waiting for launch (1pts)". Your flight will not begin until the system detects a launch.
<h1>Detecting a launch</h1>
<p>The system does not begin recording a flight until it detects a launch. By default, this is when you have either travelled 
40 (130 feet) metres horizontally or 7 meters (23 feet) vertically. Once you've achieved the required change, 
the system will begin recording. The flight will appear in your flight list (the second tab) when you press the
"Stop Logging" button.</p>
<p>You can change the minimum required travel in the <a href="preferences.html">Advanced Preferences</a> options.</p>
<h1>Customizing the fields you see</h1>
<p>There are many fields available in the flight tab, including Vertical and Horizontal Speed, Glide Ration, Altitude, heading, Lat, Long and many more.</p>
<p>Some fields only have a value if you are using a flight plan including Waypoints and a Landing Zone.</p> 
<p>You can customise the fields that are shown during a flight, hiding any that you don't find useful, by select Menu -> Customize Fields and deselecting
any that you don't want to show.</p>
