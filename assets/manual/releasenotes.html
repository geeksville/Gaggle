<li>Info fields are now customizable (press Menu to see options) and default to a larger font</li>
<li>Larger font for map info fields, make them a bit more transparent</li>
<li>Switch to the Apache HTTP client because it works with more sites than the Sun one</li>
<li>We now support CompeGPS generated wpt files - thanks Mat_d</li>

<li>Better reporting of very large glide ratios</li>
<li>Better automatic launch detection (less delay before we detect launch)</li>
<li>Sometimes the GPS reports bogus speeds while it is acquiring a lock, check for these clearly bogus values.</li>

</ul>
Changes since 0.22

<li>Bug fix: Don't let the user add waypoints if we don't have a GPS fix yet</li>
</ul>
Changes since 0.21
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug when "Simulate GPS Data" was requested but the mock locations option in system settings was off</li>
<li>If only a 2D position fix is available, don't report altitude or glide ratio</li>
<li>Units were messed up on the speed display</li>
<li>If the GPS is not yet reporting speed, don't show the user bogus numbers</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fix bug where waypoint graphics might not appear promptly</li>
<li>Color code the waypoints on the main flight instruments</li>
<li>Improve the formating on the waypoint info window</li>
<li>Fix bug where the 'start logging' button would show the incorrect state</li>
</ul>
Changes since 0.19:
<ul>
<li>Waypoints are now color coded based on glide: Red = not in glide, Yellow = barely in glide, Blue = in glide (The altitude margin for 'barely' can be set in the preferences panel).</li>
<li>Auto detect launch and landing for logging purposes - I may need to tune the distances, but this should be a good start</li>
<li>On the map view you can tap on waypoints to see distance and glide required</li>
</ul>
Changes since 0.18:
<ul>
<li>Turn off support for Android 1.5.  <br><br>Some of the latest improvements are just too hard to support on that old release - if you are using an older device you will need to upgrade.  If you are using a G1 and your carrier has not yet upgraded it, supposedly the following <a href="http://www.sizzledcore.com/2009/10/28/how-to-upgrade-t-mobile-g1-to-android-16/">upgrade instructions</a> work.</li>
<li>We now default to using the 'real' Leonardo servers</li>
<li>Fix stretching of icons in the waypoint list view</li>
<li>Force the flight instruments to use portrait mode</li>
</ul>
Changes since 0.16:
<ul>
<li>A new menu entry in the map screen recenters to the user's location</li>
<li>The map view now supports satellite or regular view (via the menu).</li>
<li>There is now a preferences item to keep the screen from going to sleep.</li>
<li>Fix a bug which would cause waypoint distances/glide ratios to not show.</li>
<li>Minor fix to support Android 1.5</li>
<li>First build after switching to a new development system, please let me know of any problems.</li>
</ul>
Changes since 0.15:
<ul>
<li>I decided to throw caution to the wind and remove the password needed to run the application (effectively making this an open beta test).  Please don't announce yet on paragliding forum or other sites though.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Changes since 0.14:
<ul><li>Very basic documentation is now included in the "About/Help" menu item.</li>
<li>We now poll for waypoints far less often - which lowers battery drain and increases responsiveness.</li>
<li>If no waypoints are found, default to instructions on how to download waypoints.</li>
<li>If no flights  found, default to instructions on how to start flight logging.</li></ul>
<br>
Changes since 0.13:
<ul><li>Gaggle now registers as able to open IGC files, so IGC files on the net or local filesystem will open with our map viewer</li>
<li>We now record tracklogs using the interval that was set in preferences</li>
<li>This release will cause the database of old flights to get wiped.&nbsp; Since I don't think anyone is doing a lot of flying right now, I was too lazy to write an auto updater.&nbsp; Future upgrades will preserve database contents.</li>
<li>For testing purposes, you can enable "Simulate GPS Data" in the preferences.&nbsp; It will playback a prestored flight.</li>
<li>Waypoints now appear on the map</li>
<li>You can now create/view/edit/delete/goto waypoints.&nbsp; Waypoints can have a 'type' set and Gaggle will automatically show GR to nearest LZs</li>
<li>Waypoints are now sorted by distance by default</li>
<li>When importing waypoints we now automatically recognize launches and LZs (point your android browser at http://www.santacruzparagliding.com/NCXC/NCXC_2010_waypoints.wpt ) for an example<br>
</li></ul>
<br>
Changes since 0.10:<br>
<ul><li>We now support Android 1.5 devices (previously Android 1.6 was required)</li>
<li>Flights with only one datapoint will now zoom correctly on the map view</li>
<li>a long-click on the flight logs will let the user delete the flight, email it or upload to Leonardo</li>
<li>Preferences entries (such as pilot name) that should be limited to one line are now so limited</li>
<li>We show tabs that are correct for the current mode of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>If the web browser visits wpt links (for example http://www.santacruzparagliding.com/NCXC/NCXC_2010_waypoints.wpt), we now auto add the points to our waypoint DB</li></ul>
